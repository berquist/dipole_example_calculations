# dipole_example_calculations

Comparison of calculating the molecular dipole moment using several different computational chemistry packages and several routines built atop the open-source Python pacakges [PyQuante](https://github.com/berquist/pyquante), [pyquante2](https://github.com/rpmuller/pyquante2), and a simple [recursive Obara-Saika integral implementation](https://github.com/berquist/obarasaika).
